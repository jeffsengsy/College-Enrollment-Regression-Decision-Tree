📊 College Enrollment Prediction with Regression & Decision Tree

This project explores student enrollment data and applies Regression and Decision Tree models to predict enrollment likelihood based on various academic, demographic, and interest-related variables.

The goal is to analyze key factors that influence whether a student enrolls and evaluate model performance for predictive accuracy.

🚀 Project Overview

Dataset: Student enrollment records with features such as academic interests, school background, and other attributes.

Objective: Predict whether a student will enroll based on given variables.

Approach:

Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Regression Model (baseline)

Decision Tree Classifier (interpretable model)

Model Evaluation (Accuracy, AUC, F1-score, etc.)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy → data preprocessing

matplotlib, seaborn → visualization

scikit-learn → modeling (Regression & Decision Trees)
